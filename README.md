Description: A baseline calculator app with arithmetic, square root and ^2 functions, and relational operators.  

How-to: Enter your first and second number, then the type of math you wish to perform on the numbers.  Note that if you are using relational operators, the second number is always being compared to the first one, not the other way around.  e.g. if your numbers are 7 and 13 and you choose "isgreater", you will get "false".
** once you are done with calculations or want to see your history, enter "no" at the prompt.

Special Features: Specific calculation types, and history of made calculations.
